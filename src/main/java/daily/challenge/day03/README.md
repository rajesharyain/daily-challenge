The `UniqueDigit` class provided contains a method `findUnique` that aims to find the first unique integer in an array. Here's a detailed explanation of the code:

### Explanation

1. **Initialization**:
    - `numSet` is a `HashSet` used to store integers that have been encountered once.
    - `removedSet` is another `HashSet` used to store integers that have been encountered more than once.

2. **Method: `findUnique`**:
    - **Input Check**:
        - If the input array `nums` is empty (`length < 1`), the method returns `-1`, indicating there are no unique elements to be found.
    - **Loop Through Array**:
        - The method iterates over each integer (`num`) in the input array `nums`.
        - **Condition 1**: If `num` is not in `numSet` and not in `removedSet`:
            - The integer `num` is added to `numSet`.
        - **Condition 2**: If `num` is already in `numSet`:
            - The integer `num` is removed from `numSet`.
            - The integer `num` is added to `removedSet`.

3. **Return Value**:
    - After the loop completes, the method checks if `numSet` is empty.
    - If `numSet` is empty, it means there are no unique integers, so it returns `-1`.
    - If `numSet` is not empty, it returns the first element from `numSet` using `numSet.iterator().next()`.

### Key Points

- **HashSet for Fast Lookups**:
    - The use of `HashSet` allows for O(1) average time complexity for add, remove, and contains operations. This makes the solution efficient even for large input arrays.

- **Handling Duplicates**:
    - The `numSet` keeps track of integers that have been encountered once.
    - The `removedSet` keeps track of integers that have been encountered more than once.
    - When an integer that is already in `numSet` is encountered again, it is removed from `numSet` and added to `removedSet`.

- **Edge Case Handling**:
    - The method correctly handles the case when the input array is empty by returning `-1`.

### Summary

The `findUnique` method efficiently identifies the first unique integer in an array using two `HashSet` collections. This approach ensures that each integer is processed in constant time on average, leading to an overall time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the input array. This solution is both efficient and easy to understand.
